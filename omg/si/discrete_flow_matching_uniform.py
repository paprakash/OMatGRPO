        Following https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04997, we construct a rate matrix R by
        R(i,j|x_1) = ReLU((dp(j|x_1)/dt) - (dp(x_t|x_1)) / (S * p(x_t|x_1)),
        and add noise via "detailed balance" rate matrices R_db (see appendix)
        R_db(i,j|x_1) = eta * delta(i,x_1) + eta * delta(j, x_1) * (St + 1 - t) / (1 - t).
        We adapt the code in Listing 8 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04997.

        In addition, we discretize time instead of using a continuous time Markov process.

        TODO: I think we should implement a continuous-time Markov process in the future.

        TODO: We should introduce an abstract class based on the abstract functions in Listing 8. Then this should work
        for arbitrary base distributions.
